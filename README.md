This repo holds Groovy script templates based on existing, publicly available validation rules. 

These scripts are meant to be modified to verify rules of construction for GCIA, SAM, IML, DSDM, and JCDL Cameo models.

By importing profiles that contain validation rules, a validation suite can be constructed and applied to a Cameo project. 

These suites with automatically verify compliance with rules of construction for the aforementioned architecture style guides.
